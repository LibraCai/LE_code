## How to use

* mean_ly_exponents.m — for computing mean finite-time stochastic Lyapunov exponents (Lorenz system's Langevin equation) via theoretical estimation and stochastic simulation.

* distribution_ly_exponents.m — for computing and comparing the distribution of finite-time stochastic Lyapunov exponents (Lorenz system's Langevin equation) via theoretical estimation and stochastic simulation.

* Within the functions folder: ly_exp_numerical.m — for numerical computation of stochastic Lyapunov exponents (Langevin equation); ly_exp_theoretical.m — for theoretical estimation.

* The code for Figure 2 of the article is located in the folder Fig.2.
